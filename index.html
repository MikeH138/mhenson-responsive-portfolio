                        Hello, my name is Mike Henson. I am 24 years old, and I'm an aspiring web developer. I've lived in Connecticut my entire life so far, but I do love to travel. A friend and I actually made plans to travel internationally together in a couple years after watching a documentary series on Netflix, called <em>Departures</em>. Hopefully the world is back to normal by then.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I graduated high school in 2014, and worked full-time as a customer service associate in retail for several years while attending Tunxis Community College part-time. Initially, I just took some general education courses, while I explored what I wanted to pursue as a career. Eventually, I came to realize that Computer Science would be a good fit for me. Both of my parents have decades of experience in the industry, and because of them I became fascinated with computers and technology from a young age.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy listening to many different genres of music, playing video games with friends, going on hikes, and cooking.
                    </p>
