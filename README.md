# Responsive Portfolio Project


## Description

This portfolio was made with bootstrap.

It contains:

* An about me page, which consists of a brief autobiography, an image of myself, link to my resume and contact info.

* A page which showcases my first project, called No Waste Kitchen, a Day Planner app, and a Weather Dashboard app.

* A contact page, which has a form with 2 text inputs (one for name, and one for email) as well as a textarea tag, where the user can type their message for me.
